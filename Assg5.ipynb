        "1. **Improves Performance for I/O-bound Tasks**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Multithreading allows a program to **perform multiple I/O operations simultaneously**, e.g., reading files, network requests, or database queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Better Resource Utilization**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * While one thread is waiting (e.g., for user input or network response), other threads can continue running, improving **CPU utilization**.\n",

        "4. **Simplifies Program Design**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Complex applications (like servers handling multiple clients) can be structured as **multiple threads** instead of managing separate processes.\n",
